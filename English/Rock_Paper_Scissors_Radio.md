# Rock Paper Scissors Radio
Adapt the previous rock paper scissor code with *radio functionality*:
- transmit the randomly selected choise on a microbit radio channel
- now wait on the same radio channel until you've received the randomly selected choise of your oponent's micro:bit.
- after reception calculate the result and display one of 3 icons 
  1. you are the winnner
  2. you are the looser
  3. both had the same choise


*HINTS:*
- Use the radio channel number that is shown on your name badge
- Use 2 boolean variables for monitoring the start of a new game and the reception of a remote random choise
- Draw a 3x3 table with all possible outcomes, fill in this table when you win/loose or play equal.
- Use the table to make a nested if, then, else block to display the different icons
